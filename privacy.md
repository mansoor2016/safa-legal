# Privacy Policy

**Safa - Islamic Companion App**

*Last Updated: February 2026*

---

## Overview

Safa is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your spiritual journey is deeply personal, and your data should remain yours.

**The short version:** We don't collect your data. Your information stays on your device and your personal iCloud account. We never see it.

---

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Email addresses
- Names or personal identifiers
- Location history
- Prayer logs or religious practice data
- Quran reading history
- Conversation history with the AI companion
- Usage patterns tied to your identity
- Device identifiers for tracking

---

## Data Storage

### On Your Device

All your data is stored locally on your iPhone:

- Prayer times and logged prayers
- Quran bookmarks and reading progress
- Dhikr counts and streak data
- Hasanat (points) and achievements
- AI companion conversation history
- App preferences and settings

### iCloud Sync (Optional)

If you have iCloud enabled on your device, your Safa data may sync to your personal iCloud account. This sync is:

- **Controlled by Apple**, not Safa
- **Encrypted** using your Apple ID credentials
- **Private** - Safa cannot access your iCloud data
- **Optional** - You can disable iCloud sync in your device settings

Apple's privacy policy governs iCloud data: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

---

## AI Companion

The AI companion in Safa runs **entirely on your device**. Your questions and conversations:

- Are processed locally using on-device machine learning
- Are never sent to external servers
- Are never used to train AI models
- Remain completely private

---

## Analytics

We use only Apple's built-in App Analytics to understand aggregate, anonymous usage patterns (such as which features are popular). This data:

- Is collected and anonymized by Apple
- Cannot be used to identify individual users
- Does not track you across apps or websites
- Is governed by Apple's privacy practices

We do **not** use third-party analytics services like Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel, or similar tools.

---

## Advertising

Safa does not display advertisements. We do not:

- Show banner ads, video ads, or pop-ups
- Sell or share data with advertisers
- Use tracking pixels or advertising SDKs
- Participate in ad networks

---

## Third-Party Services

Safa does not integrate with third-party services that collect personal data. The app functions entirely offline, with optional iCloud sync through Apple's services.

---

## Children's Privacy

Safa does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we don't collect personal information from any users, this concern does not apply to our app.

---

## Data Requests

Since we don't collect or store your data on our servers, we cannot:

- Provide copies of your data (it's already on your device)
- Delete your data from our servers (we don't have it)
- Share your data with authorities (we don't have access to it)

To delete your Safa data, simply delete the app from your device. To delete iCloud-synced data, manage it through your iPhone's Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud.

---

## International Users

Safa operates the same way regardless of your location. Since data remains on your device and we don't process personal data, international data transfer concerns do not apply.

For users in the European Union: We do not process personal data as defined under GDPR. Your data remains under your control on your device and Apple's iCloud services.

---

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will:

- Update the "Last Updated" date
- Notify users through the app if changes are significant
- Never retroactively change how existing data is handled
