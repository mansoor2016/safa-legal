# Privacy Policy

**Safa - Islamic Companion App**

*Last Updated: February 2026*

---

## Overview

Safa is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your spiritual journey is personal, and your data stays on your device.

**The short version:** Your data lives on your iPhone. We do not operate servers, we do not have accounts, and we cannot see your information.

---

## Data Stored on Your Device

Safa stores the following data locally on your iPhone:

| Data | Purpose | Stored Where |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Prayer logs | Track prayer completion and streaks | On-device (Core Data) |
| Quran bookmarks and reading progress | Resume reading, track progress | On-device (Core Data) |
| Dhikr counts and streaks | Track daily remembrance goals | On-device (Core Data) |
| Hasanat (points) and achievements | Gamification and motivation | On-device (Core Data) |
| App preferences and settings | Calculation method, theme, madhab | On-device (UserDefaults) |
| Saved location coordinates | Calculate prayer times without GPS | On-device (UserDefaults) |
| Ramadan fasting and taraweeh logs | Track Ramadan worship | On-device (UserDefaults) |

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it (see "Your Rights" below).

---

## Permissions We Request

### Location (When In Use)

Safa requests location access to calculate prayer times and determine Qibla direction. Your location is:

- Used on-device only for prayer time calculation
- Saved locally as coordinates so the app works without repeated GPS access
- Never sent to any server
- Not required — the app falls back to a default location if you decline

### Microphone and Speech Recognition

Safa requests microphone and speech recognition access for Arabic pronunciation practice. Audio is:

- Processed entirely on-device using Apple's speech recognition framework
- Never recorded, stored, or transmitted
- Not required — pronunciation practice is optional

### Notifications

Safa requests notification permission to send prayer time reminders. Notifications are:

- Scheduled locally on your device
- Never used for marketing or advertising
- Not required — all features work without notifications

### HealthKit (Optional)

If you enable HealthKit sync, Safa writes Ramadan fasting sessions to Apple Health. This data is:

- Written only when you explicitly enable the feature
- Governed by Apple's HealthKit privacy protections
- Never used for advertising, marketing, or data mining
- Never shared with third parties

Safa does not read any data from HealthKit.

---

## Network Connections

Safa's core features (prayer times, Quran, hadith, dhikr) work entirely offline. The app makes network connections only for:

- **Quran audio:** Recitation audio is downloaded from quranicaudio.com and cdn.islamic.network when you play or pre-download audio. No personal data is sent — only the audio file is downloaded.

No other network connections are made. There are no analytics servers, no crash reporting services, and no tracking pixels.

---

## AI Companion

The AI companion in Safa runs entirely on your device using Apple's on-device machine learning. Your questions and conversations:

- Are processed locally
- Are never sent to external servers
- Are never used to train AI models
- Remain completely private

---

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Email addresses, names, or personal identifiers
- Location history or movement patterns
- Browsing or search history
- Device identifiers for tracking
- Usage patterns tied to your identity

---

## Third-Party Services

Safa does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only external connections are to Quran audio CDNs (see "Network Connections" above), which do not receive any personal data.

We use Apple's built-in App Analytics to understand aggregate, anonymous usage patterns. This data is collected and anonymized by Apple and cannot identify individual users.

---

## Advertising

Safa does not display advertisements. We do not sell or share data with advertisers, use tracking pixels, or participate in ad networks.

---

## Children's Privacy

Safa does not collect personal information from any users, including children. Since no data leaves the device and no accounts are required, children's privacy concerns do not apply.

---

## Your Rights

You have full control over your data:

- **Delete selectively:** Remove specific categories (prayer logs, Quran progress, streaks, etc.) from Settings > Data Management
- **Delete everything:** Remove all app data from Settings > Data Management > Delete All Data
- **Export your data:** Export all data as JSON or prayer logs as CSV from Settings > Export Data
- **Revoke permissions:** Disable location, microphone, HealthKit, or notifications at any time without losing core functionality
- **Delete the app:** Removing Safa deletes all local data

---

## Calendar Export

Safa can export Islamic calendar events and prayer times to your device's Calendar app. These events are written to your local or iCloud calendar (depending on your device settings) and are managed by you through the Calendar app.

---

## International Users

Safa operates the same way regardless of your location. Since data remains on your device and we do not process personal data on servers, international data transfer concerns do not apply.

For users in the European Union: We do not process personal data as defined under GDPR. Your data remains under your control on your device.

---

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will:

- Update the "Last Updated" date
- Notify users through the app if changes are significant
- Never retroactively change how existing data is handled
