# Terms of Service

**Safa - Islamic Companion App**

*Last Updated: February 2026*

---

## Agreement to Terms

By downloading, installing, or using Safa ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

---

## Description of Service

Safa is an Islamic companion app that provides:

- Prayer times based on your location
- Quran text with translations
- Hadith collections
- Dhikr and dua references
- An AI companion for Islamic questions
- Learning tools for Arabic and Tajweed
- Progress tracking and gamification features

---

## Important Disclaimers

### Religious Guidance

Safa is a **tool for learning and practice**, not a replacement for qualified Islamic scholarship.

- **Consult qualified scholars** for personal religious rulings (fatwas), especially regarding marriage, divorce, inheritance, and financial matters
- **Content is informational** and represents general Islamic knowledge from mainstream sources
- **Differences exist** between schools of thought (madhabs); the App attempts to present multiple views where relevant
- **The AI companion** provides educational information but is not a scholar, mufti, or religious authority

### Prayer Times

Prayer times are calculated using established astronomical algorithms. However:

- **Verify important prayers** (especially Fajr and Maghrib during Ramadan) with local mosques or Islamic centers
- **Calculation methods vary** by region and scholarly opinion
- **You are responsible** for choosing the appropriate calculation method for your location and madhab

### Accuracy of Content

While we strive for accuracy in Quranic text, translations, and hadith:

- **Translations are interpretations** and may not capture full meaning
- **Always refer to qualified teachers** for proper understanding
- **Report errors** if you find any, so we can correct them

---

## Acceptable Use

You agree to use Safa only for lawful purposes consistent with Islamic ethics. You may not:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or modify the App
- Use the App to spread misinformation about Islam
- Redistribute the App's content without permission
- Attempt to access other users' data (not that we have any)
- Use the App in any way that violates applicable law

## Changes to Terms

For significant changes, we will attempt to notify users through the App.

---

## Termination

You may stop using the App at any time by deleting it from your device.

We reserve the right to terminate or restrict access to the App for users who violate these Terms, though given our privacy-first design, enforcement options are limited.
